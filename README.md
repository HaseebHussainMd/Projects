About NETFLIX

Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 222M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

Conducted an in-depth analysis of Netflix's dataset, which consists of 12 features and approximately 10,000 records. I handled null values and duplicates by cleaning and unnesting the data using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas) and visualized various graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Created comprehensive visualizations to highlight top genres, directors, and actors, and evaluated optimal times for releasing the content. Generated insights on the duration between movie releases and their addition to Netflix to inform strategic decisions.
